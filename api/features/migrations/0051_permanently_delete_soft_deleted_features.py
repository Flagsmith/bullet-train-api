# NOTE: For some reason, when migrating backwards, this has incompatibilities with the previous migration to remove
# indexes (0050) so they cannot be run together in the same command. i.e. if the current state is at 0051 or above,
# running `python manage.py migrate features 0049` will fail with
# ValueError: Cannot query "FeatureState object (<id>)": Must be a "FeatureState" instance.
# To get around this, you can run each migration backwards individually, i.e.
# `python manage.py migrate features 0050 && python manage.py migrate features 0049`
