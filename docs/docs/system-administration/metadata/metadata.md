Flagsmith allows certain Entities within a Project to have Metadata of different types. You can create the metadata
fields in the project settings pages -> metadata.

### Core Entities that support Metadata

- **[Features](/basic-features/managing-features#use-metadata)**.
- **[Environment](/system-administration/environment-settings#use-metadata)**.
- **[Segments](/basic-features/managing-features#use-metadata)**.

### Types of Metadata

Metadata supports five primary types of metadata, each serving distinct purposes:

**String**: A basic data type representing text or alphanumeric characters. Strings are versatile and can describe a
wide range of attributes or characteristics.

**URL**: A type specifically designed to store web addresses or Uniform Resource Locators.

**Integer**: A numeric data type representing whole numbers without decimal points. Integers are useful for quantifiable
properties or attributes.

**Multiline String**: Similar to a standard string but capable of storing multiline text. Multiline strings are
beneficial for longer descriptions or content blocks.

**Boolean**: A data type with only two possible values: true or false. Booleans are ideal for representing binary
attributes or conditions.
